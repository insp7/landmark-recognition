# Landmark Recognition
An end-to-end application to predict landmarks from images, retrieve geolocation details, and visualize results on an interactive map.

## Features
- Simple repsonsive UI.
- It will give you the full address of Landmark
- It will provide you the `Latitude` & `Longitude` of predicted landmark.
- It will plot the predicted landmark on the Map.

## Model & Data Source
- Leveraged a Pretrained TensorFlow-Hub Model ([`landmarks_classifier_asia_V1/1`](https://tfhub.dev/google/on_device_vision/classifier/landmarks_classifier_asia_V1/1)) for Landmark Classification
- Supports roughly 98,961 landmark classes covering Asiaâ€™s most iconic sites.
- This model was trained on [`Google Landmarks Dataset V2`](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/05/announcing-google-landmarks-v2-improved.html).
